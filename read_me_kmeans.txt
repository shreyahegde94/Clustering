
1) All the files required are under the folder Code in the submission

2) The source code is a file named kmeans.py (Python version 2.7) and it can be run using the command 

	python kmeans.py

3) Once you enter the command, you'll get a prompt on the terminal saying

				Enter the file name:
				Enter number of clusters:
				Enter the number of iterations:
				Enter the initial centroids:

   Enter the input file you want to use.
   Enter the number of clusters you want your data to be partitioned into.
   Enter the number of iterations you want your code to run for.
   Enter the indices of the centroids you want to start with.

   Example:
				Enter the file name:cho.txt
				Enter number of clusters:10
				Enter the number of iterations:10
				Enter the initial centroids:1,3,4,5,8,12,34,9,23,15

4)You will get output on the terminal, which consists of the following:

				The clusters
				Jaccard Coefficient
				Rand Coefficient
				PCA visualization of result
