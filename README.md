# Clustering

• Implemented K-means, Hierarchical agglomerative clustering (with single link) and Density based clustering to find clusters of genes that exhibit similar profile.                
• Visualized and compared different clustering results using Principal Component Analysis.          
• Used an external index (Jaccard Coefficient) to compare the results produced by different clustering algorithms.
